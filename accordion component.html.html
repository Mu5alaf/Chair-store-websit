        <p>Although, as discussed above, traditional rattan garden furniture is still made from the natural rattan palms
            using a wicker weave, synthetic rattan furniture is now also a common sight in UK gardens.

            While traditional rattan furniture is made from rattan material with a wicker weave - which creates a
            durable and weatherproof item -
            synthetic rattan is crafted from a resin that is specially manufactured to resemble the real thing. This
            synthetic material does have
            a number of advantages, including typically being much cheaper than real rattan, however it doesn't tend to
            offer the same wide-ranging
            natural benefits that rattan can provide, including weatherproof and UV resistant properties.</p>
